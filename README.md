# Call Flow Designer sample applications
The 3CX Call Flow Designer (CFD) allows you to easily create call flows and voice applications visually â€“ without requiring any programming or scripting knowledge. You can, for example, query a caller for a customer number, validate this number against a database and route the call based on customer type. This repository contains sample applications that demonstrate different usage scenarios.
